## CECAM Flagship School, {{ page.dates }} (online)

### Summary

The school is aimed at students and researchers from different disciplines who
already use, or plan to use, first-principles techniques to simulate properties
of matter at the atomic scale. In particular, the school will focus on the
SIESTA method [1,2]. Participants will learn its essential theoretical
foundations, and how to use the SIESTA code effectively. Pre- and
post-processing tools will also be presented. The format of the school
(completely online) allows for a flexible offering of modules of different
levels, from basic to advanced, so that participants can adapt their syllabus.
In addition, the material prepared for the school will be integrated into the
corpus of SIESTA documentation, which will remain available for continuous
learning.

### Format

The School will be formally held in the week of June 28 -- July 2nd, 2021, but
the week before participants are expected to watch pre-recorded lectures,
prepare their local computer setup, and work on simple exercises. Throughout
the School week,  live meetings will be offered in two tracks (morning and
afternoon in Central-European Time) to try to adapt to an audience distributed
over different time zones, and will consist of reviews of relevant concepts
(with Q&A sections) and guided hands-on exercises.

An online support forum will be open before, during, and for some time after
the canonical school dates to provide further guidance, to answer questions,
and to facilitate discussions between school students and tutors.

### Course materials

The materials for the school will be:
 - Pre-recorded video [lectures](Lectures.html)
   covering the necessary theoretical background
   and/or how-tos for specific features.
 - The [Siesta Documentation](https://docs.siesta-project.org/projects/siesta/) site,
   which contains the repository of
   [SIESTA tutorials](https://docs.siesta-project.org/projects/siesta/tutorials/)
   (from which the school tutorials will be selected) and additional relevant documentation.
 - The
   [Siesta Mobile virtual machine (v0.2)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14V50YRuJfW1jxdWkQzZPnTx0TIa10ftX), based on the
   [Quantum Mobile](https://quantum-mobile.readthedocs.io/) and packaged
   with the necessary codes and supporting school files, for the hands-on
   exercises.

### Program

The live sessions of the school will take place from 09:30 to 12:30 CEST (Track
A) and from 16:00 to 19:00 CEST (Track B), with breaks.
It is expected that two modules will be covered in each session.

Background lectures and hands-on modules will cover an assortment of topics,
from basic and fundamental to advanced. Students focusing on basic to medium
level topics will be able to work on the relevant modules throughout the
school. More advanced students will be able to work on their own selection of
topics (although real-time support to specific topics might be limited to
specific sessions of the school).

UPDATE: You may find detailed information on the planned sessions and tutorials
[here](Sessions.html).

### Registration

Persons interested in registering for the School need to submit **two
registration forms**:

- First, they need to apply through the “Participate” tab of
  the [CECAM school web page](https://www.cecam.org/workshop-details/5).

- Second, they need to submit the online form at
  <https://forms.office.com/r/BQYpMkku4V>
  using the same email address that they provided to CECAM.

Apart from basic identification and affiliation data,
prospective students will be asked to provide a brief statement of motivation,
a very brief CV (one paragraph), and indications of preferences for topics.

**Please submit both forms, persons who only apply through only one of the two
forms will not be accepted** to the school.

Due to our finite resources, we can only handle a finite number of students in
the live sessions, and hence we must limit the number of officially registered
participants. Nevertheless, the material and some forum channels will be
available at a later date also for those not officially admitted to the school.

The deadline for applications is the **4th June 2021**. We will communicate our
acceptance decisions by the 11th June. Accepted participants will be given
access to the materials starting on the 21st June.
