This module of the Open Knowledge Programme will outline how to perform first
principles calculations of any magnetic/nonmagnetic system in which spin-orbit
coupling (SOC) is relevant using the SIESTA code. This will allow you to
describe the influence of SOC on the electronic structure of the materials,
extracting different properties from the SIESTA output files. You will also
acquire a basic knowledge of the theoretical models on which the calculations
are based.
