## CECAM Flagship School, {{ page.dates }} (online)

### Summary

The school is aimed at students and researchers from different disciplines who
already use, or plan to use, first-principles techniques to simulate properties
of matter at the atomic scale. In particular, the school will focus on the
SIESTA method [1,2]. Participants will learn its essential theoretical
foundations, and how to use the SIESTA code effectively. Pre- and
post-processing tools will also be presented.

### Format

The School will consist of lectures from senior SIESTA developers
and hands-on sessions where SIESTA experts will be available for discussion and guidance.
These sessions will take place between 12:30 CEST and 17:30 CEST.

Autonomous work on the exercises will be possible throughout the day.

**UPDATE: You may find detailed information on the planned sessions and tutorials
[here](Sessions.html).**

### Course materials

The school will make extensive use of the
[Siesta Project Documentation](https://docs.siesta-project.org/projects/siesta/en/school-2021/) site,
which will be updated with new tutorials.

The hands-on sessions will involve remotely executing pre-compiled versions of SIESTA on HPC
systems located at the [Barcelona Supercomputing Center](https://www.bsc.es/).  Indications on how to connect
to BSC will be provided to accepted participants well in advance in order to ensure
that they can install any tools they may require on their local computers.


### Registration

Persons interested in registering for the School need to apply through the “Participate” tab of
  the [CECAM school web page](https://www.cecam.org/workshop-details/1240).

Please make sure that your CECAM account is up to date and uses your current
institutional email address.

On the application form, please provide a brief statement of motivation
and attach your CV.

The deadline for applications is the **4th September 2023**.

We will review applications in stages and we will communicate all
our acceptance decisions by email by the 8th September.
The names of all the accepted participants will appear on the
[participants tab](https://www.cecam.org/workshop-details/1240#participant_tab) of the CECAM website.

### Further training

This SIESTA school will include an introduction to the TranSIESTA functionality of SIESTA.
After the school, the **TranSIESTA (+ TBtrans + sisl) School 2023**
will be held at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) in Kongens Lyngby, Denmark,
between the 13th and 17th November 2023.
The tutorial will be a continuation of prior successful workshops based on [https://github.com/zerothi/ts-tbt-sisl-tutorial](https://github.com/zerothi/ts-tbt-sisl-tutorial).
Please check the [TranSIESTA School 2023](../TranSIESTA_School-2023) page for further information,
including registration and a tentative program.
