Topics covered (may be subject to changes):

* Usage of TranSIESTA/TBtrans and sisl.
* Correlated systems and the mean field Hubbard model.
* Inelastic transport.
* Single contacts by removal of periodic images.
* Modelling of extremely large systems with DFT precision.

It will cost 100 EUR to participate, paid in advance.

Previous schools have lectures hosted [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyi1DHDq2RGnN-Vaigq5lTA/videos?view=0&sort=da&flow=grid).

The schools material will be based on [this repository](https://github.com/zerothi/ts-tbt-sisl-tutorial).

Please engage in sisl usage discussions on the [sisl Discord channel](https://discord.gg/5XnFXFdkv2).
