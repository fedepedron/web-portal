<h3>Pseudopotentials for SIESTA</h3>

<p>SIESTA uses pseudopotentials to represent the electron-ion
interaction (as do most plane-wave codes and in contrast to so-called
"all-electron" programs). In particular, the pseudopotentials are of
the "norm-conserving" kind.</p>

<p> Pseudopotentials can be generated and tested by a number of
  programs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
</p>Until recently the SIESTA distribution included the ATOM program,
but it is no longer bundled due to licensing issues.  If you are an
academic user, you can download it
from <a href="http://www.icmab.es/siesta/Pseudopotentials/atom_licence.html">here</a>.</p>

<li><p>For non-academic users, or for those looking for more
pseudopotential options, we recommend a visit to
the <a href="http://www.nnin.org/search/node/pseudopotential">Virtual
Vault for Pseudopotentials</a>. Use one of the pseudopotential
generators listed as providing output compatible with Siesta (such as
APE) and follow the proper procedures for testing.</p>

<p>Remember that all pseudopotentials should be thoroughly tested
before using them. (See the standard literature on
pseudopotentials and the user manuals for ATOM and other generation
codes for more information on testing).</p>

<p>It follows that databases of pseudopotentials should be used with
  care. Unless an explicit description of the generation conditions
  and testing procedures is given, a pseudopotential found in a
  database should be treated as a starting point for further refinement.
</p>

<p>An example of this kind of database is the one generated by
  translating into the .psf format the pseudopotentials generated with
  the fhi98pp program for the Abinit project. It can be found 
  <a href="http://www.icmab.es/siesta/Databases/Pseudopotentials/periodictable-intro.html">
   here</a>.
