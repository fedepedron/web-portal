<h2>Pseudopotentials for SIESTA</h2>

<p>SIESTA uses pseudopotentials to represent the electron-ion
interaction (as do most plane-wave codes and in contrast to so-called
"all-electron" programs). In particular, the pseudopotentials are of
the "norm-conserving" kind.</p>

<h3>Pseudopotentials in the PSF format</h3>

<p>Versions of SIESTA before 5.0 use pseudopotential files in the
  'Froyen' (psf) format. These pseudopotentials can be generated and
  tested by a number of programs, which include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Until recently the SIESTA distribution included the
      <a href="https://docs.siesta-project.org/projects/atom/en/latest/">ATOM program</a>,
but it is no longer bundled.  If you are an
academic user, you can download it
from <a href="{{site.material_baseurl}}/Pseudos/atom_licence.html">here</a>.</p>

<li><p> The Atomic Pseudopotential Engine (APE) is a computer package
designed to generate and test norm-conserving pseudopotentials within
Density Functional Theory. The generated pseudopotentials can be
either non-relativistic, scalar relativistic or fully relativistic and
can explicitly include semi-core states. A wide range of
exchange-correlation functionals is included through Libxc.</p>

</ul>

<p>We used to provide a database of pseudopotentials in psf format,
  but we no longer do, as their quality was uneven. A database of
  pseudopotentials is still available at
  the <a href="https://nninc.cnf.cornell.edu/">Virtual Vault for
  Pseudopotentials</a> site, but please remember that all
  pseudopotentials should be thoroughly tested before use. (See
  the standard literature on pseudopotentials and the user manuals for
  ATOM and other generation codes for more information on
  testing).</p>


<h3>Curated pseudopotentials in the PSML format</h3>

<p>In contrast, curated pseudopotential databases offer a higher level
  of testing and quality assurance. For example, the <a href="http://www.pseudo-dojo.org">PseudoDojo</a> is an open
  source project for developing and
  systematically testing pseudopotentials. These are generated with
  the multi-projector norm-conserving generator ONCVPSP, tested with
  seven different batteries of tests with ABINIT, and made
  available in a web-based database in several formats.
</p>
<p>Users of SIESTA willing to try these
  pseudopotentials can use the <a href="https://gitlab.com/siesta-project/siesta/-/releases/5.0.0-beta1">
    new 5.0 (beta) version</a> or the
  <a href="https://gitlab.com/siesta-project/siesta/tree/master">
    development version of
    SIESTA</a>,  which have support for the
  new <a href="https://esl.cecam.org/data/psml/">PSML format</a>.
