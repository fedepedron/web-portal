<h3>Pseudopotentials for SIESTA</h3>

<p>SIESTA uses pseudopotentials to represent the electron-ion
interaction (as do most plane-wave codes and in contrast to so-called
"all-electron" programs). In particular, the pseudopotentials are of
the "norm-conserving" kind.</p>

<p>The released versions of SIESTA use pseudopotential files in the
  'Froyen' (psf) format. These pseudopotentials can be generated and
  tested by a number of programs:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Until recently the SIESTA distribution included the ATOM program,
but it is no longer bundled due to licensing issues.  If you are an
academic user, you can download it
from <a href="{{site.material_baseurl}}/Pseudos/atom_licence.html">here</a>.</p>

<li><p>For non-academic users, or for those looking for more
pseudopotential options, we recommend a visit to
the <a href="http://www.nnin.org/search/node/pseudopotential">Virtual
Vault for Pseudopotentials</a>. Use one of the pseudopotential
generators listed as providing psf output compatible with Siesta (such as
APE) and follow the proper procedures for testing.</p>

</ul>

<p>Remember that all pseudopotentials should be thoroughly tested
before using them. (See the standard literature on
pseudopotentials and the user manuals for ATOM and other generation
codes for more information on testing).</p>


<h3>Curated pseudopotentials in the PSML format</h3>

<p>In contrast, curated pseudopotential databases offer a higher level
  of testing and quality assurance. For example, the <a href="http://www.pseudo-dojo.org">PseudoDojo</a> is an open
  source project for developing and
  systematically testing pseudopotentials. These are generated with
  the multi-projector norm-conserving generator ONCVPSP, tested with
  seven different batteries of tests with ABINIT, and made
  available in a web-based database in several formats.
</p>
<p>Users of SIESTA willing to try these
  pseudopotentials can use the
  <a href="https://gitlab.com/siesta-project/siesta/tree/master">
    development version of
    SIESTA</a>,  which has support for the
  new <a href="https://esl.cecam.org/data/psml/">PSML format</a>.
