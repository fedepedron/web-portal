<h1>SIESTA School 2021: Sessions unfolded</h1>


<h2>Discord</h2>

<p>
Most of the school will take place on
the Siesta 
<a href="https://discord.com">discord</a> server.
</p>

<h3>Before the school starts</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
    Please make sure that your computer has an up to date version of the discord app.  If discord is not installed in your computer, please download it from <a href="https://discord.com/download">discord.com/download</a> and install it in your computer.
    </p>

<p>
(We know discord may be used from the browser, but we have experienced so many problems with the web version that we strongly recommend the standalone app. We also know discord may be used on a phone, but given that you will probably need to type, copy texts, etc. from/to discord, we also strongly recommend that you install it in a computer.)
</p>

  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Please make sure that you have a verified discord user account that you can use to login to the discord app.  If you don't have a discord user you may see an option for registering at the end of the discord installation, you can follow that or access <a href="https://discord.com/register">https://discord.com/register</a> on the browser.  Once your account is created you will receive an email message asking you to verify the account, please verify it (click where appropriate, you should see an "Account verified!" message in your browser).
  </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>At the beginning of the school</h3>

<p>All School participants will receive an invitation to the SIESTA Discord server.
<b>Please make sure that you are logged in on the discord app before you click on the invitation link.</b>

<p>When participants enter the server for a first time they are assigned a role.
This determines what channels (chat rooms) they can see.
Please be patient until your role is assigned - while you wait you may only see the welcome channel and some voice channels,
and you may see an error message saying that "Messages Failed To Load".  This is normal and should
not be reported.
The self-explanatory roles relevant to the school are:
<kbd>2021-student-trackA</kbd>,
<kbd>2021-student-trackB</kbd>,
<kbd>tutor</kbd> (users highlighted in green),and
<kbd>organiser</kbd> (users highlighted in red).
</p>

<p>When you are given a role, please check that your track is correct by clicking on your username
(for example on the Members List in the right column of the window).  Students should have roles
<kbd>2021-student-trackA</kbd> or  <kbd>2021-student-trackB</kbd> depending on whether
they are participating in Track A or Track B, respectively.  If your role does not match your track,
please report it as soon as possible in the <kbd>SCHOOL 2021 #it-issues</kbd> channel.
<p>

<h3>During the school</h3>
<p>
The discord server contains a list of text channels and audio/video channels that can (should) be used
for discussion.
</p>

<p>
Text channels are grouped in categories.  Students of Track X should see the
       following categories: <kbd>EVERYBODY</kbd>, <kbd>SCHOOL 2021</kbd>, <kbd>TRACK X</kbd>, <kbd>TRACK X: BASIC</kbd>, and <kbd>TRACK X: ADVANCED</kbd>.
       Discord provides tools for hiding/silencing categories/channels that you are not interested in
       (e.g., if you are working on the basic tutorials, you may want to silence/hide
       exchanges taking place in the <kbd>TRACK X: ADVANCED</kbd> category.
</p>
<p>
   Most text channels will be dedicated to specific tutorials and tracks, e.g.,
       <kbd>TRACK B: ADVANCED #TDDFT</kbd>.  Each of these
       channel specifies and links to a particular
       tutorial,
       and <b>students/tutors should use that channel when discussing that tutorial</b>.
</p>

<p> Other relevant channels are:
<ul>
  <li> <kbd>SCHOOL 2021 #announcements</kbd>: Announcements relevant to all school participants. </li>
  <li> <kbd>SCHOOL 2021 #it-issues</kbd>: Channel for reporting all IT issues (Siesta Mobile, discord, zoom, etc.). </li>
  <li> <kbd>SCHOOL 2021 #org-feedback</kbd>: Conversation about the organisation of the SIESTA School 2021. Please let us know if you are having difficulties, how we could improve the school, etc. If you liked something in particular please let us know too! </li>
  <li> <kbd>TRACK X #announcements</kbd>: Announcements only relevant to Track X.</li>
  <li> <kbd>TRACK X #general</kbd>: This is the channel for general conversation about SIESTA.
</ul>


<p> Text channels allow for some level of <kbd>text formatting</kbd>,
and you may ping another participant by mentioning his username preceded by a <kbd>@</kbd>.
Please use these tools wisely and respectfully
(e.g., don't mention other participants unnecessarily).
</p>

<p>You will soon notice that the names of tutors and organisers are printed in green and red, respectively.

<p>
Finally, each audio/video channel allows for a conversation
       with an unlimited number of participants with audio and
       a maximum of 25 participants broadcasting video.  You should join the channel when the
       conversation starts, and "hang up the phone" when the conversation ends.
       We have been given advice that this should work reasonably
       for small numbers participants in the audio/video call,
       but that the quality may degrade for large numbers of participants.
</p>


<h2>Tutorials</h2>

<p>
As you will see, we have classified all tutorials in two categories
according to their level: basic and intermediate/advanced.
</p>

<h3>Warning</h3>
<p>
We took the opportunity of this school to create a new SIESTA documentation site,
<a href="https://docs.siesta-project.org/projects/siesta/">https://docs.siesta-project.org/projects/siesta/</a>.
This is a <a href="https://readthedocs.org/">Read the Docs</a> site
that provides a fresh and modernised look to
"traditional" SIESTA tutorials, some of which have been updated/revamped,
as well as a number of new tutorials created for the school.
</p>

<p>
Please bear in mind that some tutorials (scheduled for the last days of the school)
may only become available mid-week.
Also, we think of the tutorials as a dynamic learning system, so we may update
them (or add more of them!)
as the sessions progress in order to incorporate improvements and/or
adapt them based in your feedback and our experiences.
Any changes or updates to the tutorials will be announced in the <kbd>#announcements</kbd> text channel of
the <kbd>SCHOOL 2021</kbd> category.
Thank you for your understanding as we improve the SIESTA learning materials.
</p>


<h3>Before you start</h3>
<p>
Before you start working on the tutorials, please set up your local working environment
by following the instructions provided in
<a href="https://docs.siesta-project.org/projects/siesta/tutorials/01-installation.html">Setting up the local working environment for the tutorial exercises</a>.
</p>

<h3>Basic tutorials</h3>

<p>
If you are new to SIESTA, or if you want to refresh the basics, please
complete the basic tutorials in <a href="https://docs.siesta-project.org/projects/siesta/tutorials#basics-of-siesta">Basics of Siesta</a> in the provided order.  They are:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.siesta-project.org/projects/siesta/tutorials/basic/first-encounter">A first encounter with Siesta</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.siesta-project.org/projects/siesta/tutorials/basic/first-crystals">First crystals</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.siesta-project.org/projects/siesta/tutorials/basic/pseudopotentials">Pseudopotentials</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.siesta-project.org/projects/siesta/tutorials/basic/basis-sets">Basis sets</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.siesta-project.org/projects/siesta/tutorials/basic/grid-convergence">The real-space grid</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.siesta-project.org/projects/siesta/tutorials/basic/kpoint-convergence">Sampling of the BZ with k-points</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.siesta-project.org/projects/siesta/tutorials/basic/scf-convergence">The self-consistent-field cycle</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.siesta-project.org/projects/siesta/tutorials/basic/structure-optimization">Structural optimization using forces and stresses</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.siesta-project.org/projects/siesta/tutorials/basic/vibrational-properties">Vibration modes and phonons</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.siesta-project.org/projects/siesta/tutorials/basic/magnetism">Magnetism</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
On discord, you will see a <kbd>TRACK X: BASIC</kbd> category (group of channels) that contains one
text channel for each of the tutorials, please use them appropriately.  Tutors will regularly
provide support for these tutorials during the track sessions.
</p>

<h3>Intermediate/advanced tutorials</h3>

<p>If you are an experienced SIESTA user you probably will want to start with these tutorials from
the first day.</p>

<p>
We have selected 10 intermediate/advanced tutorials (from now on, "advanced" for the sake
of text clarity) to ensure that, at least during a 90 minute period
during the week (for each track), there will be a specialised lead tutor available to discuss the tutorial.  At other times, you are free to work on the tutorial,
and the same tutor (or others) may be available to support the
tutorial, but this is not guaranteed.
</p>

<p> If you are happy to work on this selection, the following availability table
may work as the program of the school:

<p>
Most lead tutors will be giving a short introduction to the advanced tutorial using zoom
at the beginning of the 90 minute period.
Please check the discord <kbd>#announcements</kbd> text channel of your track for updates.
</p>

<p>
In addition to those 10 advanced tutorials, we also support
a few other tutorials in a less dedicated mode.  This means that we are not planning
for a specific 90 minute session to discuss them, but that specialised tutors
will be available at different times of the week to support students working on them.
These tutorials could be used as "homework".
