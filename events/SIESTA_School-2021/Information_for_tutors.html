<h2>Tutorials</h2>

<h3>Materials (WIP)</h3>

<h4>Tutorials (WIP)</h4>
<p>
We took the opportunity of this school to create a new SIESTA documentation site,
<a href="https://docs.siesta-project.org/projects/siesta/">https://docs.siesta-project.org/projects/siesta/</a>.
This is a <a href="https://readthedocs.org/">Read the Docs</a> site
that provides a fresh and modernised look to
"traditional" SIESTA tutorials, some of which have been updated,
as well as a number of new tutorials created for the school by some of the tutors.
You will find the full list of tutorials
<a href="https://docs.siesta-project.org/projects/siesta/tutorials/index.html">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
As you will see, we have classified all tutorials in two categories
according to their level: basic and intermediate/advanced.
</p>

<p>
The tutorial material is still being uploaded and edited to the site.
Most tutorials will be completed later this week, and we
expect some fine-tuning later, even during the school itself.
We welcome your suggestions.
</p>

<h4>SIESTA Mobile (WIP)</h4>
<p>
Students will run the tutorials using Siesta Mobile,
a virtual machine based on the Quantum Mobile developed by Marvel and MaX.
For more information,
including the link to the virtual machine <kbd>.ova</kbd> file, see
<a href="https://docs.siesta-project.org/projects/siesta/tutorials/01-installation.html">
https://docs.siesta-project.org/projects/siesta/tutorials/01-installation.html
</a>.
</p>

<p>
Please feel free to try to run the tutorials in the Siesta Mobile and to
report any issues to us via the #software-issues channel on <a href="#discord">discord</a>.
</p>

<h3>Sessions unfolded</h3>

<p>
From the point of view of <b>students</b>:
Students should have watched all lectures by the start of the week,
and they may choose freely what tutorials to run, and when to run them.
However, we will issue some recommendations:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Experienced students should probably focus on the
       <b>intermediate/advanced tutorials</b>.
  </li>
  <li> Students that never have used SIESTA and
       students that consider that they need to review the basics
       should try to follow the <b>basic tutorials</b>
       <a href="#basic_tutorials">listed below</a>, and in that order.
  </li>
  <li> In any case, students interested in <b>intermediate/advanced tutorials</b>
       should bear in mind that we will only guarantee support for each tutorial during the
       <a href="#advanced_schedule">time slots specified below</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
From the point of view of <b>tutors</b>:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> The level of <b>basic tutorials</b> is such that we believe that most tutors
       will be able to support students doing most of them without much preparation.
       We believe that there isn't much point in trying to plan sessions for these tutorials
       since the spread of skills and background will inevitably lead to a broad
       range of paces in completing the tutorials.
  </li>
  <li> For each <b>advanced tutorial</b> and track
       we suggest a "lead tutor"
       (see <a href="#advanced_schedule">the table at the bottom of the page</a>).
       The lead tutor 
       will give a very short introduction to the tutorial at the beginning of the
       90 minute block, and should act as the ultimate reference for the tutorial.
  </li>
  <li> The student/tutor ratio will be between 3 and 4.
  </li>
  <li> Student support will be a team effort. If you are a "junior" tutor, please do not
       feel anxious about questions you don't know how to answer: do not hesitate to ask for help
       to a more "senior" tutor, and use the opportunity as a learning experience. Remember
       that thanks to you providing support on matters you are confident about,
       other tutors have the time to address the issues that don't fall within your expertise.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Platforms</h3>

<h4 id="discord">Discord</h4>

All discussions and support are expected to take place on a
<a href="https://discord.com">discord</a> server.

<ul>
  <li> The server contains a list of text channels and audio/video channels that can be used
       for discussion.
  </li>
  <li> Text channels allow for some level of <kbd>text formatting</kbd>.
  </li>
  <li> Each audio/video channel allow for a conversation
       with an unlimited number of participants with audio and
       a maximum of 25 participants broadcasting video.  You should join/leave the channel when the
       conversation starts/ends. We have been given advice that this should work reasonably
       for small numbers participants in the audio/video call,
       but that the quality may degrade for large numbers of participants.
  </li>
  <li> Most text channels will be dedicated to specific tutorials and tracks, e.g.,
       "Track B: Advanced phonons".  It will be clear what channel corresponds to
       each tutorial, and <b>students/tutors should use that channel when discussing
       that tutorial</b>.  These channels still need to be created.
  </li>
  <li> There will also be some channels reserved to tutors, and some channels
       available to students for general SIESTA conversation.
  </li>
  <li> Participants will be assigned a role (tutor, track A student, track B student)
       which will determine what text channels they can access.
  </li>
  <li> You can connect to discord with a web browser or with the dedicated app.
       We have noticed difficulties using discord's audio/video on the web browser,
       so <b>we strongly recommend that everybody installs the dedicated discord app before
       Monday 28th June</b>.
  </li>
  <li> <b>Tutors should register on discord (using the provided invitation) by Friday 25th June,
       so that we can assign them the tutor role and they can explore the platform.</b>
       Note that, on arrival, you may have very restricted permissions until we give you
       tutor status.
  </li>
  <li> Students will be given their invitation on Monday 28th June.
  </li>
</ul>
       

<h4>Zoom</h4>
<p>
The initial introduction to each advanced tutorial will be a short
<a href="https://zoom.us">zoom</a> call.
Zoom will also be available in case further in-person discussion is needed
and the audio/video discord channels become problematic.
</p>

<p>If you are a lead tutor, please make sure that you can broadcast zoom audio/video.
The call links will be provided by the organisers.</p>
