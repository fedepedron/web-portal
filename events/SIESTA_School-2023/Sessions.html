<h1>SIESTA School 2023: Sessions unfolded</h1>


<h2>Zoom</h2>
All lectures will be delivered via 
<a href="https://zoom.us">zoom</a>.  Accepted participants will be sent the zoom link before the school starts.
Zoom breakout rooms will also be used to facilitate small-group discussions with tutors during the hands-on activities.
</p>


<h2>Discord</h2>

<p>
All written exchanges of text, commands, images, etc. will take place on
the Siesta 
<a href="https://discord.com">discord</a> server.
</p>

<h3>Before the school starts</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
    Please make sure that your computer has an up to date version of the discord app.  If discord is not installed in your computer, please download it from <a href="https://discord.com/download">discord.com/download</a> and install it in your computer.
    </p>

<p>
(We know discord may be used from the browser, but we have experienced so many problems with the web version that we strongly recommend the standalone app. We also know discord may be used on a phone, but given that you will probably need to type, copy texts, etc. from/to discord, we also strongly recommend that you install it in a computer.)
</p>

  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Please make sure that you have a verified discord user account that you can use to login to the discord app.  If you don't have a discord user you may see an option for registering at the end of the discord installation, you can follow that or access <a href="https://discord.com/register">https://discord.com/register</a> on the browser.  Once your account is created you will receive an email message asking you to verify the account, please verify it (click where appropriate, you should see an "Account verified!" message in your browser).
  </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>At the beginning of the school</h3>

<p>All School participants will receive an invitation to the SIESTA Discord server.
<b>Please make sure that you are logged in on the discord app before you click on the invitation link.</b>

<p>When participants enter the server for a first time they are assigned a role.
This determines what channels (chat rooms) they can see.
Please be patient until your role is assigned - while you wait you may only see the welcome channel and some voice channels,
and you may see an error message saying that "Messages Failed To Load".  This is normal and should
not be reported.
The self-explanatory roles relevant to the school are:
<kbd>2023-Student</kbd>,
<kbd>2023-Tutor</kbd> (users highlighted in green), and
<kbd>2023-Organiser</kbd> (users highlighted in red).
</p>

<h3>During the school</h3>
<p>
The discord server contains a list of text channels and audio/video channels that can be used
for discussion.
</p>

<p>
There is a section (<kbd>2023 SCHOOL</kbd>) with all the channels of the school.
There will be a channel dedicated to the lectures and tutorials of each of the days of the school (<kbd>#day-1</kbd>, <kbd>#day-2</kbd>, and so on).
Please use these channels for discussions about the sessions of the day.
There is also a <kbd>#general</kbd> channel for other conversations related to the school.
</p>

<p> Other channels with self-explanatory purposes can be found in the <kbd>EVERYBODY</kbd> section of the server.
    Please bear in mind that the scope of those channels is the whole SIESTA project, so there may be users there who
    are not part of the school.
</p>

<p> Text channels allow for some level of <kbd>text formatting</kbd>,
and you may ping another participant by mentioning his username preceded by a <kbd>@</kbd>.
Please use these tools wisely and respectfully
(e.g., don't mention other participants unnecessarily).
</p>

<p>
Finally, we discourage the use of the audio/video channels, since we will already
be using the zoom breakout rooms.
</p>


<h2>Tutorials</h2>
<p> Hands-on sessions will heavily use
the SIESTA documentation site,
<a href="https://docs.siesta-project.org/projects/siesta/en/school-2023/">https://docs.siesta-project.org/projects/siesta/en/school-2023/</a>.
</p>

<p>
All the computational work will take place on MareNostrum 4, an HPC system of the Barcelona Supercomputing Centre.
Participants will have access to MareNostrum 4 only for the duration of the school.
Please see <a href="MN4.html">MN4</a> for instructions.
</p>

<h2> Tentative programme</h2>

<p>
All times are CEST (UTC+2). Color codes:
<span class="lecture">&nbsp;lecture&nbsp;</span>,
<span class="practical">&nbsp;practical (usually includes a presentation/short lecture)&nbsp;</span>,
<span class="break">&nbsp;break&nbsp;</span>,
<span class="general">&nbsp;other&nbsp;</span>.
