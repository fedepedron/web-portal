<H2>SIESTA code access</H2>
 

SIESTA development has recently moved from Launchpad to
<a href="https://gitlab.com/siesta-project/siesta">Gitlab</a>.

<p> Starting in the Spring of 2016, with the 4.0 version, SIESTA
  is released under the terms of the GPL open-source license. Source
  packages and access to the development versions can be obtained from
  the <a href="https://gitlab.com/siesta-project/siesta">Gitlab site</a>.
</p>

<p> For an overview of the various
  strands of development, please see
  this <a href="https://gitlab.com/siesta-project/siesta/-/wikis/Guide-to-Siesta-versions">Guide to SIESTA versions</a>.
</p>

<p> Other versions of SIESTA are distributed free
  of charge to academics (please see the detailed conditions in the
  licence text), and can be installed by computer centers to be used
  only by academics. These are not open source versions: they cannot
    be redistributed. They can be accessed
