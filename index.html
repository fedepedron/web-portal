SIESTA is both a method and its computer program implementation, to
perform efficient electronic structure calculations and ab initio
molecular dynamics simulations of molecules and solids.  SIESTA's
efficiency stems from the use of a basis set of strictly-localized
atomic orbitals. A very important feature of the code is
that its accuracy and cost can be tuned in a wide range, from quick
exploratory calculations to highly accurate simulations matching the
quality of other approaches, such as plane-wave methods.

The possibility of treating large systems with some first-principles
electronic-structure methods has opened up new opportunities in many
disciplines. The SIESTA program is open source and has become quite
popular, being increasingly used by researchers in
geosciences, biology, and engineering (apart from those in its natural
habitat of materials physics and chemistry). Currently there are
several thousand users all over the world, and the paper describing
the method
