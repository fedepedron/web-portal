We are pleased to announce the release of Siesta-4.0.1
This version should be the default choice for production for most users.

You can read the Release Notes and obtain the tarball in the [release page](http://launchpad.net/siesta/4.0/4.0.1).

Note in particular the BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY ISSUES and the TECHNICAL
NOTES sections in the Release Notes for some important issues
regarding backwards compatibility with 3.X versions and previous
development snapshots.

See the file REPORTING_BUGS in the Docs/ directory of the distribution
for instructions to report bugs and suggestions.

This release fixes several bugs related to non-colinear spin
calculations as well as some memory-related issues that may cause
segmentation faults in rare occasions. Issues with the
Util/STM/ol-stm program have been fixed while its functionality has
increased. Lastly some extra control and logging capabilities have
been added to facilitate the use of Siesta in external computational
frameworks.
