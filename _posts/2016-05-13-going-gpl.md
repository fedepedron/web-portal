title: "Siesta to be released with GPL license"
date: 2016-05-13

The SIESTA developers have decided to change the licensing conditions
for the code. From now on, SIESTA will be released under the [GPL
open-source license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License).

In the past SIESTA had always been free for academic use, but
re-distribution was not permitted. It is expected that the move to an
open-source license will be beneficial for the SIESTA project and its
large user community. On the one hand, the program will be able to
incorporate functionality already existing in other GPL codes. On the
other, the barrier for contributors will be lowered, as new
developments will be more easily re-distributed.

Development and distribution of the program is now centralized at the
[Launchpad platform](http://launchpad.net/siesta)

Users can download tarballs of released versions, as well as clone the
source branches of the appropriate series directly. Prospective
contributors are encouraged to become familiar with the Launchpad
workflow and to read the specific documentation that is being prepared
for Siesta development.

The current stable series is '4.0', which is in advanced
betastage. Users are encouraged to download it and use it for
production runs.
